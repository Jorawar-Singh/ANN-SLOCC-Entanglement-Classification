# ANN-SLOCC-Entanglement-Classification
Python code as Jupyter Notebooks for the work presented in the paper titled "Entanglement Classification of Arbitrary Three-Qubit States via Artificial Neural Networks" 

https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11330
\
If you use this code, please consider citing the article.

Notebook 1 - Data and Features contains code for generating quantum states, extracting and analysing features (density matrix elements) for the ANN Models. It exports the training and test datasets for the ANN Model.
\
Notebook 2 - ANN Models cointains the code for ANN Model creation, training, and evaluation for SLOCC and GME Classification problem.
